## Abstract

The genetic programming is originated from the evolutionary algorithm. Similar to "pass from parents to children and evolve" in the nature, the genetic algorithm could be applied to simulate the signal evolution. By setting the specific fitness, this algorithm may dig out those hidden and hard-to-find by human formulas. In the old days, research on excavating factors is established on Formula after Logic, while the genetic programming offers us another view, which is Logic after Formula.

In this project, I used the Genetic Programming to excavate signals for stocks, with Rank IC as fitness, N-day future returns as labels, two typical periods of A share market as training sets and several functions as operators. And the model finally generated several signals with distinct horse racing quantiles and high Rank IC values.
